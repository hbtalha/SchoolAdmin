High School Student Management System

The program is based on the High School System of my country, Cape Verde.

As here, the official language is portuguese, the entire program is written in portuguese, meaning all the comments and variables are in portuguese.

The program focuses only on the student management side of the system and the school, so the school management and possibly the teachers and other workers are to be added.

I wrote this program a long time ago and even though a lot has been improved, it still has many aspects in which it can be bettered.
